          Hello all! Currently Minima is created and supported by me, Brayan Byrdsong. CSS has always been a passion of mine, and Minima is truly joyous to work on. If anyone would like to support Minima or I, you can donate through cashApp to <b>$brayanbyrdsong</b>. If you don't have cashApp you can sign up <a href="https://cash.me/app/KDLQLKT" target="_blank">here</a> and we'll both get $5!
